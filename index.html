            <h2 class="cabecera"><abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action for the Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
            <h2 class="cabecera">Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> in New York</h2>
            <p>
                <i>New York, 5 July 2023</i> - The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to 
                rally for the Sustainable Development Goals (<b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b>), the roadmap for people and planet adopted
                by world leaders in 2015. Ahead of a critical <b><abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr></b> Summit in September, the campaign aims to 
                amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for 
                sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda 
                for our common future.
            </p>

            <p>
                At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b> is in peril. For the first time 
                in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, 
                conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.

                The 2023 <b>SDG</b> Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York 
                on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to 
                leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track 
                to achieving the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the <b>UN</b>

                Building off the color wheel brand of the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b>, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for 
                its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b> through 
                the <b><abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr></b>'s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising 
                for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate 
                progress on the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b> and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.

                A curated group of high-profile influencers from entertainment, sports and beyond, the Circle of Supporters, 
                will galvanize their social media communities with a combined reach of more than 80 million globally to take 
                individual action on the <b><abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></b> and to impress upon decisionmakers the urgency to act now.
